Evaluate and rank code snippets based on their semantic clarity. Semantic clarity means how effectively each snippet communicates what it does through the meaningfulness and clarity of its variable names, function names, and the logical organization of concepts. Assess each snippet for how immediately and unmistakably a reader can understand the purpose and intent of each component without needing to reverse-engineer or infer meaning from unclear naming. Consider the quality and expressiveness of naming conventions, whether names directly convey intent, how obviously the code's purpose is self-evident through its structure, and whether the logical organization mirrors the problem domain being solved.
