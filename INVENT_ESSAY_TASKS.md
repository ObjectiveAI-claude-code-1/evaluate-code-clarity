1. **Evaluate Semantic Transparency of Naming**: Analyze all names used throughout the code snippet—including variable names, function names, class names, and domain-specific terms—to assess how effectively and unmistakably they communicate their purpose and meaning. Determine whether each name clearly conveys what the entity represents and what it does, or whether readers would need to search for context clues and reverse-engineer the meaning. Consider whether names align with industry standards and the problem domain being addressed.

2. **Assess Structural Intent and Logical Organization**: Examine how the code is organized and structured to determine whether its form mirrors and communicates the logical flow of the problem it solves. Evaluate whether related operations are grouped meaningfully, whether the sequence of steps feels natural and inevitable rather than arbitrary, whether concerns are appropriately separated, and whether the overall architecture makes the purpose and intent immediately apparent without requiring readers to trace through details first.
